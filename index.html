<img src="images/kazi_nazrul.JPG" width="200" alt="man">
<p>Kazi Nazrul Islam (24 May 1899–29 August 1976) was a Bangladeshi poet, musician and revolutionary. His nickname was "Rebel Poet". He was the first to make poems talking about intense spiritual rebellion against fascism and oppression. Nazrul is the national poet of Bangladesh.[1] He is commemorated in India.

Born into a Muslim family in India, Nazrul received religious education. He worked as a muezzin at a local mosque. He learned of poetry, drama, and literature while working with theatrical groups. After being in the British Indian Army, Nazrul made himself a journalist in Kolkata (then Calcutta). He was against the British Raj in India. He talked about revolution through his poetic works. Some examples are "Bidrohi" ("The Rebel") and "Bhangar Gaan" ("The Song of Destruction"), as well as his publication "Dhumketu" ("The Comet"). His work in the Indian independence movement often led to going to jail by British authorities. While in prison, Nazrul wrote the "Rajbandir Jabanbandi" ("Deposition of a Political Prisoner").

Nazrul's writings are about themes such as love, freedom, and revolution. He was against all bigotry, including religious and gender. Throughout his career, Nazrul wrote short stories, novels, and essays but is best known for his poems. He started new forms such as Bengali ghazals. Nazrul wrote and composed music for his nearly 4,000 songs.[2] The are collectively known as Complete Works of Kazi Nazrul Islam, which are widely popular today. At the age of 43 (in 1942) he began suffering from an unknown disease. He was losing his voice and memory. It is often said, the reason was slow poisoning by British Government. He lived alone for many years. Invited by the Government of Bangladesh, Nazrul and his family moved to Dhaka in 1972. He died four years later.</p>
<h2>Jasim uddin</h2>
<img src="images/jasimuddin.jpg" width="200" alt="man">
<p>Jasimuddin (1903-1976) poet and litterateur, was born on 1 January 1903 in his maternal uncle’s home at Tambulkhana in Faridpur. His father Ansaruddin Mollah was a teacher at school. Jasimuddin studied for some time at Faridpur Welfare School. He then went to Faridpur Zila School, wherefrom he matriculated in 1921. He completed IA from Rajendra College in 1924, and BA and MA in Bangla from the University of Calcutta in 1929 and 1931 respectively.

From 1931 to 1937, Jasimuddin worked as ramtanu lahiri assistant research fellow under dinesh chandra sen, collecting folk literature. In 1938 he joined the university of dhaka as a lecturer. He left the university in 1944 to join the Department of Information and Broadcasting. He continued working in Broadcasting, first under the Bengal government and then under the East Pakistan Government, until his retirement as Deputy Director in 1962.

Jasimuddin’s talent as a poet developed early. As a college student, he wrote the poem ‘Kabar’ (Grave). The poem, a dramatic monologue of an old man talking to his grandson in front of his wife’s grave, was included in school textbooks while Jasimuddin was still a student at university.

Jasimuddin’s first book of verse, Rakhali (Shepherd), was published in 1927. His other books are naksi kanthar math (1929), Sojan Badiyar Ghat (1933), Rabgila Nayer Majhi (1935), Matir Kanna (1951), Suchayani (1961), Padma Nadir Deshe (1969), Bhayabaha Sei Dingulite (1962), Padmapar (1950), Beder Meye (1951), Pallibadhu (1956), Gramer Maya (1959), Thakur Badir Abinay (1961), Germanir Shahare Bandare (1975), Smaraner Sarani Bahi (1978), Bangalir Hasir Galpa, Dalim Kumar etc. He also wrote a novel, Boba Kahini (1964). He edited two books on folk music: Jarigan (1968) and Murshida Gan (1977). Naksi Kanthar Math and Bangalir Hasir Galpa have been translated into English as The Field of the Embroidered Quilt and Folk Tales of East Pakistan respectively.

Called ‘Palli Kavi’ (folk poet), Jasimuddin is the poet of rural Bengal, depicting the natural beauty of the rural world as well as the lives and sensibilities of village people. His poetic rhythms are drawn from folk poetry, easy on the ear and quick to put them in memory. He was also a writer of fine prose, fluent, witty, and expressive.

Jasimuddin was one of the pioneers of the progressive and non-communal cultural movement. He was an ardent supporter of socialism and of Bengali nationalism. In the 1950s when the government of Pakistan attempted to stop broadcasting tagore songs, he protested boldly.

In 1969, Jasimuddin was awarded the D.Litt by Rabindra Bharati University. He also won several awards, including the President’s Award for Pride of Performance (1958), Ekushey Padak (1976) and Swadhinata Dibas Puruskar (posthumous, 1978). In 1974 he was also selected for the Bangla Academy Award but he refused to accept it obviously on ground of recognizing his contributions much earlier. Jasimuddin died in Dhaka on 13 March 1976 and was buried in his own village. [Bimal Guha]</p>

<p>
Born	7 October 1948 (age 72)
Netrokona, East Bengal, Dominion of Pakistan
Occupation	Writer, literary editor
Language	Bengali
Nationality	Bangladeshi
Alma mater	University of Dhaka
Notable awards	Bangla Academy Literary Award (2014)[1]
Helal Hafiz (born 7 October 1948) is a Bangladeshi poet.[2] He is considered[according to whom?] a true representative of poets of his generation having certain creative traits in an age when his nation and countries in the neighbourhood witnessed dramatic transitions particularly in the arena of politics. He won Bangla Academy Literary Award (2013).[3]

Early life, education and career
On completion of his schooling and college studies at his hometown in northern Netrokona, Hafiz got himself enrolled at the University of Dhaka, at a time when it appeared as main centre of the brewing nationalist movement which eventually saw the 1971 emergence of independent Bangladesh. He is considered a true representative of the poets of his generation.[4][5] He studied at Netrokona Datta High School, Netrokona College and University of Dhaka. Hafiz earned the repute of being an established poet of verve, vigour and emptiness long ahead of the publication of his first collection of poems: Je Jale Agun Jwale (The water where fire is ignited) in 1986. It earned the best sellers status in Ekushey Book Fair of the year, discarding novels by popular writers who traditionally occupy the position in Bangladesh's biggest annual book fair.[6] "Nishiddha Sampadakiya" (The Banned Editorial), one of his most quoted poems inspired at least two generations since the pre-independence nationalist upsurge of 1969 and pro-democracy campaigns in post independence periods.

Poetry
Hafiz never associated himself directly with any political activity but his famous verses “Ekhon joubon jar juddhe jabar tar shreshtha samoy” (It's the best time for one to go to war who is in his youth) was seen in wall writings, posters, leaflets and chanted in processions at university campuses and street side walls to inspire the youths to get prepared for the Liberation War against Pakistan. It returned as a popular slogan of student activists and left-leaning organisations during popular movements against military or autocratic rules in independent Bangladesh. But Hafiz, who appeared to be a sensitive man on questions of quality, visibly preferred a self-exile from the literary arena for years after the publication of the Je Jale Agun Jwale. He explained his silence as the outcome of a sense of fright of losing popularity after the tremendous success that reached him to the peak of fame. Hafiz, however, gradually resumed his literary activities recently coming up with his Kabita Ekattur (Poems Seventy One) recently to make visible again his formidable presence in the literary arena while his third book is set to hit the bookstalls in few months.

A journalist by profession Hafiz eventually found the literature section of newspapers as his professional abode while he served as a literary editor of a number of newspapers over the past four decades. But the instability in the newspaper industry also threw him out of the job several times, exposing him to extreme difficulties. His luck in gambling earned him the repute of being a great gambler in close circle and in one of his newspaper interviews Hafiz bluntly said during his state of joblessness, gambling appeared to be his major income source for a period.

A dichotomy of love of land and devotion to the lover is clearly visible in his poems but Hafiz finds a way toward a compromise projecting himself as a tender lover and rebel patriot as he wrote “Rather today let us like the songs of Jahidur/Summon boshekh from the heart, bring in both lives /Do you know, Helen.</p>
